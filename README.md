# Expense-Explorer
This combined application serves two distinct but complementary purposes related to **data management and analysis**. The first part, built using **Streamlit**, is designed to view data stored in an **expense tracking system**. It connects to a SQLite database and allows users or administrators to inspect tables like `users`, `expenses`, and `budget_limits`. This is useful for monitoring financial records, analyzing user spending patterns, or managing budgeting limits in a simple, visual format.

The second part of the application, developed using **Flask**, mimics the behavior of **Google Sheets**. It provides a 10x10 editable spreadsheet grid where users can manually enter values, update specific cells, and perform basic calculations such as `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `COUNT` over selected ranges. This is helpful for quick, spreadsheet-like operations directly in the browser without the need for external tools like Excel. Together, these tools offer a lightweight solution for **data viewing, manipulation, and basic financial computation** in a user-friendly web interface.
