# Expense-Explorer
This combined application serves two distinct but complementary purposes related to **data management and analysis**. The first part, built using **Streamlit**, is designed to view data stored in an **expense tracking system**. It connects to a SQLite database and allows users or administrators to inspect tables like `users`, `expenses`, and `budget_limits`. This is useful for monitoring financial records, analyzing user spending patterns, or managing budgeting limits in a simple, visual format.

The second part of the application, developed using **Flask**, mimics the behavior of **Google Sheets**. It provides a 10x10 editable spreadsheet grid where users can manually enter values, update specific cells, and perform basic calculations such as `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `COUNT` over selected ranges. This is helpful for quick, spreadsheet-like operations directly in the browser without the need for external tools like Excel. Together, these tools offer a lightweight solution for **data viewing, manipulation, and basic financial computation** in a user-friendly web interface.

#Methodology
The methodology of this application involves building two lightweight web-based tools using Python frameworks—**Streamlit** and **Flask**—to handle different aspects of data management. In the first module (Streamlit-based), the application connects to a **SQLite database** (`expense_tracker1.db`) and provides a simple interface where users can select and view data from predefined tables (`users`, `expenses`, and `budget_limits`). The connection to the database is established using the `sqlite3` library, and data retrieval is handled using `pandas` for easy display in a structured tabular format.

In the second module (Flask-based), the methodology focuses on mimicking a **spreadsheet environment**. A 10x10 in-memory grid is initialized to store cell data. Flask routes are used to render the user interface, handle cell updates, and process range-based calculations like `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `COUNT`. The calculation logic is implemented in the backend using simple Python functions, and data is exchanged between the frontend and backend using **JSON via API requests**. Together, both modules demonstrate an effective methodology for managing financial data—one through database visualization and the other through interactive spreadsheet-style computations.
